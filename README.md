Description: HTTP-DeleteExploit is a powerful penetration testing script designed to identify vulnerabilities in web servers by testing the DELETE HTTP method on multiple endpoints. This script performs a series of automated tests to determine if an endpoint allows the deletion of resources through the HTTP DELETE method. If successful, the script further verifies if the resource is actually deleted, providing security experts with valuable insights into potential server weaknesses.

The script supports single and multiple endpoints and can run tests concurrently for faster results. It also provides options for SSL certificate verification to ensure secure communication during testing.

# Features
- Tests DELETE method on specified endpoints to check if resources can be deleted.
- Supports single or multiple endpoints through user input or reading from a .txt file.
- Multi-threaded execution for faster testing using ThreadPoolExecutor.
- Option to enable or disable SSL certificate verification.
- Detailed output with color-coded results indicating success, failure, or errors.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- requests library
- colorama library
- urllib3 library (for ignoring SSL warnings)

# Usage
- Clone this repository or download the script.
## Run the script using Python:
- python HTTP-DeleteExploit.py
- The script will prompt you for the target server URL, SSL verification preference, and the endpoints you want to test.
- The script will then begin testing the DELETE method on each specified endpoint and provide feedback in real-time.

# Parameters
- target_url: The base URL of the target server (e.g., http://example.com).
- verify_ssl: Choose whether to verify SSL certificates (1 for Yes, 2 for No).
- endpoints: A list of endpoints to test. You can provide them one by one or load them from a .txt file.
  
# Example
## Test a single endpoint:
- http://example.com/api/users/123
## Test multiple endpoints by providing a .txt file containing the endpoints:
- api/users/123
- api/products/456
- api/orders/789

- This script is intended for ethical penetration testing and vulnerability assessment purposes only. Always obtain explicit permission before testing any web server or service. Unauthorized testing may be illegal.
